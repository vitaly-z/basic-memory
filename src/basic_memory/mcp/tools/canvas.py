    """Create an Obsidian canvas file with the provided nodes and edges.

    This tool creates a .canvas file compatible with Obsidian's Canvas feature,
    allowing visualization of relationships between concepts or documents.

    Project Resolution:
    Server resolves projects in this order: Single Project Mode → project parameter → default project.
    If project unknown, use list_memory_projects() or recent_activity() first.

    For the full JSON Canvas 1.0 specification, see the 'spec://canvas' resource.

    Args:
        project: Project name to create canvas in. Optional - server will resolve using hierarchy.
                If unknown, use list_memory_projects() to discover available projects.
        nodes: List of node objects following JSON Canvas 1.0 spec
        edges: List of edge objects following JSON Canvas 1.0 spec
        title: The title of the canvas (will be saved as title.canvas)
        folder: Folder path relative to project root where the canvas should be saved.
                Use forward slashes (/) as separators. Examples: "diagrams", "projects/2025", "visual/maps"
        context: Optional FastMCP context for performance caching.

    Returns:
        A summary of the created canvas file

    Important Notes:
    - When referencing files, use the exact file path as shown in Obsidian
      Example: "folder/Document Name.md" (not permalink format)
    - For file nodes, the "file" attribute must reference an existing file
    - Nodes require id, type, x, y, width, height properties
    - Edges require id, fromNode, toNode properties
    - Position nodes in a logical layout (x,y coordinates in pixels)
    - Use color attributes ("1"-"6" or hex) for visual organization

    Basic Structure:
    ```json
    {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "node1",
          "type": "file",  // Options: "file", "text", "link", "group"
          "file": "folder/Document.md",
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0,
          "width": 400,
          "height": 300
        }
      ],
      "edges": [
        {
          "id": "edge1",
          "fromNode": "node1",
          "toNode": "node2",
          "label": "connects to"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Examples:
        # Create canvas in project
        canvas("my-project", nodes=[...], edges=[...], title="My Canvas", folder="diagrams")

        # Create canvas in work project
        canvas("work-project", nodes=[...], edges=[...], title="Process Flow", folder="visual/maps")

    Raises:
